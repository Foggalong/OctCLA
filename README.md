# OctCLA

Implementations of Markowitz' Critical Line Algorithm in [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). Please note that at the moment it isn't compatible with MATLAB since it uses features like default function arguments and indexing into temporary arrays which MATLAB doesn't support.
